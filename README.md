# MGS2: Widescreen Edition
 An open source widescreen enhancement for Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance.

Extract the ASI and INI files to your MGS2 install path.

Once installed, please edit the INI to set the resolution that you will be using, as well as the other options as needed. If the INI does not exist, it will be created with the default values once the game has been run.
