# MGS2: Widescreen Edition
An open source widescreen enhancement for Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance (2003). This is ***not*** for the Master Collection

## Installation
Please ensure you are currently using V's Fix, which you can find here: https://github.com/VFansss/mgs2-v-s-fix

Extract the ASI and INI files to your MGS2 install path.

```%MGS2%\bin\scripts```

Once installed, please edit the INI to set the resolution that you will be using, as well as the other options as needed. If the INI does not exist, it will be created with the default values once the game has been run.

In V's Fix, you will need to ensure that "Maintain Aspect Ratio" is disabled, as this enhancement is incompatible with nemesis2000's fix.
